# Writing styleguide notes

To be formalized...

**Referencing code block file location**

When adding code blocks that represent snippets of a file, include the location of that file at the beginning of the code block. It should be added in a comment of that file type's style and start at the root of the codebase.

Nunjucks template example:

```django
{# views/layout.html #}
```

Javascript file example:

```javascript
// modules/@apostrophecms/admin-bar/index.js
```

**REST API request types should be written as code.**

Good: Make a `GET` request.
Bad: Make a GET request.
