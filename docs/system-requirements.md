# System Requirements

While Apostrophe 3 introduces a number of new features and APIs, we still rely on the same tools. However, you do need more modern versions of a few of them.

| Software | Minimum Version | Notes
| ------------- | ------------- | -----
| Git  | Any
| Xcode  | Current | Only needed on macOS
| Node.js | 10.x | Or better 
| npm  | 6.x  | Or better
| MongoDB  | 3.6  | Or better
| Imagemagick (optional.md)  | Any | GIF support, faster image uploads

::: tip Note
As always, we recommend installing the following with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS. If you're on Linux, you should use your package manager (`apt` or `yum`). If you're on Windows, we recommend the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
