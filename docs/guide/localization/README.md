# Localization in Apostrophe

For Apostrophe, "localization," often abbreviated as **l10n**, is the process of adapting the Apostrophe user interface and Apostrophe website content for different "locales," or groups of people (usually based on language and country). This can include text translation, date formats, content variation, and much more.

Localizing Apostrophe websites is done in two contexts:

- **Static content**: localizing "hard-coded" text and other information. This primarily involves strings in template files and the Apostrophe user interface components. This will usually involve a developer, though translation will likely be done by other people. [See the related guide for more on this.](static.md)
- **Dynamic content**: translating and generally customizing content controlled through the user interface. Depending on the website needs, this may mean direct translation between locales, but may also mean major content changes for the different groups of people. This work is usually done by content editors and translators. [See the related guide for more on this.](dynamic.md)

The term "internationalization," often abbreviated **i18n** comes up when discussing this as well. See [the localization section of the glossary](/reference/glossary.md#localization-terms) for a quick overview of how we use these terms.
