## Document set

The database documents that exist as mode and locale versions of one another. For example, in a project with an English and a French locale, the home page would be managed in the database by six documents: 1) the draft English, 2) published English, 3) previous English, 4) draft French, 5) published French, and 6) previously published French. These six database documents make up the document set.
